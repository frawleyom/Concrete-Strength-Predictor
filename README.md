# Concrete Strength Predictor
Prediction of the Compressive Strength of Concrete using MLP Regression


The goal of this assignment is to complete a thorough investigation into the use of
contemporary MLP regression to solve the problem of predicting the compressive strength of
the concrete from the 8 input parameters. Key aspects of the investigation include:

• Establishing a performance figure using a non-neural network regression algorithm
(trained and tested in a comparable manner to an MLP-regression model)

• Comparing the performance of a baseline MLP-regression algorithm to that obtained
above

• Completing an investigation to optimise the performance of the MLP-regression
algorithm in terms of the hyper-parameters of the MLP-regression model

**Results from the investigation are presented in the report file located within the repository**
